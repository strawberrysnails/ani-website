========================= -->

    <h2>Couples Coaching</h2>
    <p>This is for couples who:</p>
    <ul class="offering-list">
      <li>Love each other but feel stuck in recurring conflict</li>
      <li>Want deeper intimacy but don’t know how to access it</li>
      <li>Feel the polarity has faded</li>
      <li>Struggle with communication breakdowns</li>
      <li>Are navigating life transitions (engagement, pregnancy, parenthood, career shifts)</li>
      <li>Or simply want to create something extraordinary — not average</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>How we do it</h3>
    <ul class="offering-list">
      <li>Structured communication tools</li>
      <li>Repair and conflict resolution skills</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>This is not traditional talk therapy.</strong></p>

    <h3>Liberation in relationship means:</h3>
    <ul class="offering-list">
      <li>Conflict that leads to connection</li>
      <li>Honest conversations without escalation</li>
      <li>Feeling chosen, respected, and desired</li>

   ROW 2: 1:1 COACHING (reverse)
========================= -->

<div class="offering-row reverse">
  <div class="offering-text">
    <h2>1:1 Coaching</h2>
    <p>This is for individuals
who know there’s more waiting for them—more joy, more purpose, more aliveness—but feel held back by old patterns or a sense of disconnection. If you’re ready to stop just going through the motions and start living with intention, this is for you.
</p>

    
    <h3>How We Do It:</h3>
    <ul class="offering-list">
      <li>We practice the Four P’s: Pleasure, Play, Presence, and Permission—bringing intention to everyday acts.</li>
      <li>We blend somatic work and parts work, helping you reconnect with your body and inner wisdom.</li>
      <li>We transform routine into ritual, turning daily self-care into empowerment and liberation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Liberation Means:</h3>
    <p>It’s about presence—no longer rushing through life. It’s turning everyday moments into intentional acts and manifesting a life beyond your wildest dreams—one you actively create.</p>
