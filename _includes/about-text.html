    <p>In 2020, a casual conversation about skincare ingredients turned into a life pivot.</p>
    <p>I was a recent graduate working at a grocery store looking for direction, purpose.</p>
    <p>Within a year, I completed 600 hours of training and opened my own business as a licensed esthetician at 19.</p>
    <p>Over four years, I immersed myself in advanced aesthetic training, refined my technical skill set, and built a loyal clientele who returned not just for results — but for the experience of care.</p>
    <p>For me, my work was never just about appearance. It was about confidence. Nervous system safety. Feeling seen and cared for.</p>
    <p>And eventually, I felt called to go deeper.</p>

    <p>I began studying the Vital Integrated Tantric Approach (VITA) methodology in sex, love, and relationship coaching with Layla Martin. Through that training, I developed a grounded understanding of attachment, intimacy dynamics, communication patterns, and conscious partnership. I became fascinated by how our relationships shape our sense of self — and how much freedom becomes available when we learn to relate differently.</p>
    <p>After attending a VITA retreat, I met my second teacher, Melissa Sanger, who introduced me to ceremonial bodywork — breast massage, womb massage, and ceremonial pelvic care. A reverent, consent-based way to support women through cycles, childbirth, postpartum, menopause and health challenges.</p>
    <p>During this time, I was navigating my own breast health issues. After years of seeking medical support, it was ceremonial tending — ritual, touch, devotion — that transformed my tissue and my health.</p>
    <p>I found myself sipping cacao, filling out Byron Katie’s “The Work” worksheets, and remembering something essential:</p>

    <div class="about-emphasis">
      <p>The body and our relationships are mirrors.</p>
      <p>And when we learn to work with them consciously, everything changes.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The greatest shifts weren’t only happening through touch.</p>
    <p>They were happening through awareness.</p>
    <p>Through better communication.</p>
    <p>Through learning to take responsibility.</p>
    <p>Through choosing liberation over old patterns.</p>
    <p>Sacred self-care became my foundation. Practicing pleasure, play, presence, and permission didn’t make me avoid my challenges — it gave me the capacity to meet them.</p>

      <li>Liberation from limiting beliefs.</li>
      <li>Liberation from relationship patterns that no longer serve you.</li>
