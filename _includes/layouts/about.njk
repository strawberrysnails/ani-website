      <h1>About Analiese</h1>
      <p>
        Analiese’s work lives at the intersection of devotion and embodiment.
        What began as a personal healing journey unfolded into a calling —
        guiding women and couples back into their bodies, their pleasure,
        and their power.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her spaces are ritual containers — soft yet transformative,
        grounded yet enchanted.

      <h1>Her Philosophy</h1>
      <p>
        Whimsy is not escape — it is discipline.
        Presence is not passive — it is power.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through ceremonial bodywork, relational coaching,
        and sacred self-devotion practices,
        she helps you turn the ordinary into something holy.
